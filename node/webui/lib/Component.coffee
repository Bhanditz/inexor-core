  # Component - Object oriented directive definition
  #
  # This is based on Injectable.
  #
  # # Features
  #
  # * Declare directives as classes
  # * Declare directive configuration as class variables
  # * Event declaration during class definition with @on
  # * Automatic template loading
  # * Automatically provides jQuery (@$), the jquery element (@elem),
  #   the element attributes (@$attrs) and the transclude
  #   function (@$transclude)
  #
  # # Default values
  #
  # This changes the default values for directives:
  #
  # * templateUrl - is automatically resolved so a template
  #   with the same name as the component is used.
  # * scope: {}
  # * bindToController: true
  # * controller â€“ Is automatically set so the entire class
  #   acts as acontroller
  #
  # # Usage
  #
  # Declare a class that extends Component; wrap it using
  # Component.wrap $name, ...
  #
  # See Injectable on why the wrapper is necessary.
  #
  # Note that Component should be available globally and
  # Component.wrap should be available as
  # defineComponent.
  #
  # # Example
  #
  # `components/inxFnord.coffee`
  # ```
  #   defineComponent 'inxFnord', class extends Component
  #     @inject "underscore"
  #
  #     @scope:
  #       sex: "=doMe"
  #
  #     constructor: ->
  #       console.log "Element: ", @elem
  #       console.log "sex", @$attrs.sex
  #
  #     @on "click", (event) ->
  #       console.log "I have been clicked"
  # ```
  #
  # `components/inxFnord.html.jade`
  # ```
  #   h1 This is 23 template
  #
  #   p It will be automagically loaded as the themplate of inxFnord.
  # ```

  #        wrapper class.
