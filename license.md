## License

The Inexor source code and the Inexor files 
are provided under the terms of the [ZLIB license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php) (very similar to the BSD license).

Inexor is a fork of Cube 2: Sauerbraten, which is also licensed under the ZLIB license.

### Notes

The license covers the source code directory of this archive (or the source repository on GitHub) as well as the "config" directory in the "data" directory (or the data repository on GitHub).
The included ENet network library which Inexor uses is covered by an MIT-style license, which is however compatible with the above license for all practical purposes. Other libraries have also individual licenses, which you can see in the respective readmes.

Game media included in the game (maps, textures, sounds,
models etc.) are NOT covered by this license, and may have
individual copyrights and distribution restrictions (see
individual readmes).
